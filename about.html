            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <P>
                My name is Jay and I feel in love with skateboarding at the age of 17 when my cousin showed me how to skateboard. I’ve always been interested in skating, but it took me years to get my first skateboard because my parents were worried about me injuring myself. If I had started at a younger age, I would have progressed a lot more because I would’ve been more willing to take risks and the one skate park here isn’t the best, so it takes years to see growth skateboarding here unless you travel hours to another skate park. So being 17 I had responsibilities and a job to maintain so I had to be careful doing anything because an injury can cause you to miss work. Once I started doing tricks, I did have one bad fall where I badly scrapped up my elbow and knees and I stopped skateboarding for two years. After going through a rough time in life and knowing how skateboarding was my outlet to get away from things, I built up the courage to skateboard again and spent 2019 going skating every day which helped me overcome my depression. Even though I have ADHD it hasn’t slowed me down from skateboarding if anything that’s the one thing I don’t have a hard time focusing on since skating gets me in a relaxing zone where nothing matters other than me and my skateboard. Learning tricks on the skateboard is extremely hard and I’m always my worst critic I’ve been working on getting better at. The feeling of practicing a trick and then finally landing it is the best feeling in the world. But none of the progress I’ve made at skating would have been possible if I never met my wonderful and amazing fiancé who’s my biggest fan and my inspiration that keeps me going on and off the skateboard. We even had our first date at the skate park where we first met each other. Without her support and push, and my skateboard I would be lost. Skateboarding has changed my life for the better its taught me when you fall you get up and try again. And I honestly am so glad I didn’t stop after my first fall because I wouldn’t be who I am today or wouldn’t have crossed paths with the love of my life.
            </P>
